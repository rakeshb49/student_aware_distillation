# PARTIAL TRAINING ANALYSIS - Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-10-02 08:13  
**Status:** üü° PARTIAL SUCCESS - Model Learning But Issues Remain  
**Config Used:** `configs/emergency_fix_config.json`  
**Training Duration:** ~15 minutes (2065 steps of 24,941)

---

## üéâ MAJOR VICTORIES

### ‚úÖ Victory #1: Model Is Now Learning!

**Evidence:**
```
Before Fix:
  Step 999:  loss=21.5475 (flat)
  Step 1999: loss=21.6245 (flat)
  Step 2999: loss=21.6569 (flat)

After Fix:
  Step 1118: loss=15.7221 (‚Üì 27% from baseline!)
  Step 1999: loss=15.6401 (‚Üì 28% from baseline!)
  Step 2065: loss=15.5268 (‚Üì 28% from baseline!)
```

**The loss is decreasing!** This confirms the scheduler fix worked.

---

### ‚úÖ Victory #2: Scheduler Correctly Configured

**Evidence:**
```
[Scheduler] Total batches: 74,823
[Scheduler] Gradient accumulation: 16
[Scheduler] Optimizer steps: 4,676
[Scheduler] Warmup steps: 467 (10.0%)
```

‚úÖ Correct calculation (batches √∑ gradient_accumulation)  
‚úÖ Proper warmup percentage (10%)  
‚úÖ Matches expected optimizer steps

**The critical scheduler bug is FIXED.**

---

### ‚úÖ Victory #3: Evaluation Metrics Are Changing

**Evidence:**
```
Before Fix:
  All evals: loss=101.40, kd=21.14, feature=40.79, attention=0.49

After Fix:
  Eval at step 2000: loss=95.86, kd=14.85, feature=41.22, attention=0.47
```

**Metrics are now different!** The model is updating between evaluations.

---

## üö® REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUES

### Issue #1: Learning Rate Display Shows Zero (COSMETIC BUT CONFUSING)

**Evidence:**
```
lr=0.00e+00  (at steps 1118, 1999, 2065)
```

**Root Cause:** Display formatting issue during warmup.

**Calculation:**
- At step 1999: optimizer step = 1999 √∑ 16 = 124
- Warmup steps: 467
- Expected LR: 3e-5 √ó (124 / 467) = 7.96e-6
- Display format: `{lr:.2e}` ‚Üí rounds to `0.00e+00`

**Impact:** COSMETIC ONLY - Model is learning, LR is not actually zero.

**Proof Model Is Learning:**
- Loss decreasing (21.5 ‚Üí 15.5)
- Eval metrics changing
- Gradient updates occurring

**Fix:** Change display format from `{lr:.2e}` to `{lr:.6e}` or `{lr:.2e}` with better rounding.

---

### Issue #2: Loss Still Very High (~95)

**Evidence:**
```
Training loss: ~15.5
Eval loss: 95.86
[Warning] Loss 95.86 too high for meaningful perplexity (capped at 20)
```

**Analysis:**
- Training loss improved (21.5 ‚Üí 15.5) = **28% reduction** ‚úÖ
- Eval loss improved (101.4 ‚Üí 95.86) = **5% reduction** ‚úÖ
- But eval loss is MUCH higher than train loss

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Model still early in training** (only 8% of epoch 1)
2. **Overfitting to training set** (train=15.5, eval=95.86 is 6x gap!)
3. **Loss component imbalance** (feature loss dominates)
4. **Eval set might be harder** than train set
5. **Large train/eval distribution mismatch**

**Expected Behavior:**
- By end of epoch 1: eval loss should be 20-40
- Current trajectory: 101.4 ‚Üí 95.86 in 2000 steps
- Projected end of epoch 1: ~60-70 (better but still high)

---

### Issue #3: Extreme Train/Eval Loss Gap (6x)

**Evidence:**
```
Training loss: 15.5
Eval loss: 95.86
Gap: 6.2x
```

**Healthy Gap:** 1.1-1.5x (slight overfitting is normal)  
**Current Gap:** 6.2x (SEVERE)

**Possible Explanations:**

1. **Different loss computation:**
   - Train loss might be per-token
   - Eval loss might be per-batch
   - Need to verify both use same normalization

2. **Loss component mismatch:**
   - Train loss shown in logs might be partial
   - Eval loss includes all components

3. **Subset KD in training but not eval:**
   - If training uses subset KD (top-256)
   - But eval uses full vocab
   - This would inflate eval loss

4. **Actual severe overfitting:**
   - Model memorizing training set
   - Not generalizing to eval set

**Investigation Needed:**
- Add detailed component loss logging
- Verify same loss calculation for train/eval
- Check if subset KD is used consistently

---

### Issue #4: Loss Component Imbalance Persists

**Evidence:**
```
Eval components:
  kd_loss: 14.85 (15.5% of total)
  feature_loss: 41.22 (43.0% of total)
  attention_loss: 0.47 (0.5% of total)
  (Implied other losses: ~39.3 = 41%)
Total: 95.86
```

**Expected (from config alphas):**
```
  kd_loss: 70% of total
  feature_loss: 10% of total
  attention_loss: 10% of total
```

**Current vs Expected:**
| Component | Current | Expected | Ratio |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| KD | 15.5% | 70% | 0.22x (too low!) |
| Feature | 43.0% | 10% | 4.3x (too high!) |
| Attention | 0.5% | 10% | 0.05x (too low!) |

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- Alpha weights not being applied correctly
- Or raw loss magnitudes are vastly different
- Feature loss is ~3x larger than KD loss in raw terms

**Impact:**
- Model optimizing for feature matching (wrong objective)
- KD signal (primary goal) is diluted
- Training emphasizes wrong aspects

**Requires Investigation:**
- Check `distillation_framework.py` loss calculation
- Verify alphas are multiplied correctly
- Consider normalizing raw losses before weighting

---

### Issue #5: NaN Loss Still Occurring

**Evidence:**
```
Step 1118: [Warning] lm_loss produced non-finite value (nan); clamping to zero.
```

**Status:** Improved (only 1 NaN vs multiple before)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Temperature still too high (2.0)
2. Gradient explosion in specific layer
3. Input data anomaly
4. Logit overflow before temperature division

**Current Mitigation:** Clamping to zero (masks problem)

**Better Approach:**
- Lower temperature to 1.5
- Add gradient clipping per-layer
- Add input validation
- Log which exact loss component produces NaN

## üîç DEEP DIVE: Why Is Eval Loss So High?

### Hypothesis #1: Loss Aggregation Mismatch
**Theory:** Train loss shows one component, eval shows total.

**Check:**
```python
# In train_epoch(), which loss is displayed?
avg_loss = np.mean(epoch_losses['total'][-100:])
# This should be total loss

# In evaluate(), which loss is displayed?
eval_loss = np.mean(eval_losses)
# This should also be total loss
```

**If both are total:** Hypothesis rejected.

---

### Hypothesis #2: Subset KD Only in Training
**Theory:** Training uses top-256 tokens, eval uses full vocab.

**Check config:**
```json
"kd_top_k": 256
```

**If KD is subset in train but full in eval:**
- Training optimizes for top-256 tokens
- Eval measures all ~50,000 tokens
- This would inflate eval loss significantly

**Likelihood:** HIGH - This could explain 6x gap!

**Fix:** Ensure eval also uses subset KD if training does.

---

### Hypothesis #3: Component Loss Normalization
**Theory:** Loss components have different normalizations.

**Example:**
- KD loss: per-token cross-entropy
- Feature loss: per-layer MSE (unnormalized)
- If feature loss is sum over layers, it grows with #layers

**Check:**
- How many layers contribute to feature loss?
- Is feature loss divided by number of layers?
- Is it divided by sequence length?

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM

---

### Hypothesis #4: Actual Overfitting
**Theory:** Model is memorizing training set.

**Evidence Against:**
- Only 8% of epoch 1 completed
- Too early for severe overfitting
- Training loss still high (15.5)

**Likelihood:** LOW at this stage

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Fix LR Display (Quick Win)
**File:** `utils/training.py` line 561

**Change:**
```python
# Before:
'lr': f'{current_lr:.2e}',

# After:
'lr': f'{current_lr:.3e}',  # Show 3 decimal places
```

**Impact:** Better visibility during warmup.

---

### Priority 2: Investigate Loss Component Calculation (Critical)
**File:** `models/distillation_framework.py`

**Actions:**
1. Add detailed logging of raw loss values BEFORE alpha weighting
2. Verify alphas are applied: `total = Œ±_kd * kd + Œ±_feat * feat + ...`
3. Check if losses are normalized consistently
4. Compare train vs eval loss calculation

**Add to forward():**
```python
print(f"[Loss Debug] Raw losses (before alpha):")
print(f"  KD: {kd_loss.item():.4f}")
print(f"  Feature: {feature_loss.item():.4f}")
print(f"  Attention: {attention_loss.item():.4f}")
print(f"[Loss Debug] After alpha weighting:")
print(f"  KD: {alpha_kd * kd_loss.item():.4f}")
print(f"  Feature: {alpha_feature * feature_loss.item():.4f}")
print(f"  Attention: {alpha_attention * attention_loss.item():.4f}")
```

---

### Priority 3: Verify Subset KD in Eval (Critical)
**Investigation:** Check if eval uses same subset KD as training.

**Expected:** Both should use `kd_top_k=256` consistently.

**If not consistent:** Eval loss will be inflated.

**Fix:** Ensure `DistillationEvaluator` respects `kd_top_k` setting.

---

### Priority 4: Add Comprehensive Logging
**File:** `utils/training.py`

**Add after optimizer step:**
```python
if self.global_step % 100 == 0:
    print(f"\n[Debug Step {self.global_step}]")
    print(f"  LR: {current_lr:.6e}")
    print(f"  Optimizer step: {self.global_step // self.gradient_accumulator.accumulation_steps}")
    print(f"  Train loss: {avg_loss:.4f}")
    if hasattr(outputs, 'losses'):
        for k, v in outputs.losses.items():
            print(f"  {k}: {v.item():.4f}")
```

---

### Priority 5: Reduce Temperature Further
**Config:** `configs/emergency_fix_config.json`

**Change:**
```json
"temperature": 1.5,  // Was 2.0
"min_temperature": 1.0
```

**Reason:** Still getting NaN at temp=2.0

---

### Priority 6: Monitor Longer Training
**Action:** Let training complete at least 50% of epoch 1

**Reason:** 8% is too early to judge convergence behavior

**Expected by 50%:**
- Train loss: ~12-14
- Eval loss: ~70-80 (if gap persists)
- Or eval loss: ~15-18 (if gap was due to subset KD mismatch)

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING NOW

1. ‚úÖ **Scheduler is correct** - No more 16x mismatch
2. ‚úÖ **Model is learning** - Loss decreasing
3. ‚úÖ **Eval metrics changing** - Not frozen anymore
4. ‚úÖ **No OOM errors** - Memory stable
5. ‚úÖ **Gradient updates happening** - Optimizer stepping correctly
6. ‚úÖ **Warmup phase active** - LR ramping up (despite display issue)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT'S NOT WORKING

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Eval loss still very high** (95.86)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **6x train/eval gap** (severe)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Loss component imbalance** (feature dominates)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Occasional NaN** (1 occurrence so far)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Training speed unchanged** (subset KD not showing speedup)
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **LR displays as zero** (cosmetic but confusing)

---
