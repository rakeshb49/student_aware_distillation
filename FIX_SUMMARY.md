# Student-Aware Distillation: Critical Fixes Applied

## Summary

This document outlines the critical fixes applied to resolve the training failures encountered in the Kaggle P100 environment. The main issues were vocabulary size mismatches, dataset loading problems, and attention implementation warnings.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Critical Issue: Vocabulary Size Mismatch üî¥

**Problem:**
```
RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (151936) must match the size of tensor b (49152) at non-singleton dimension 2
```

**Root Cause:**
- Teacher model (`huihui-ai/Huihui-MoE-1B-A0.6B`) has vocabulary size ~151,936
- Student model (`HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-135M`) has vocabulary size ~49,152
- KL divergence loss tried to compare tensors of different vocabulary sizes

**Solution:**
- **Created `TeacherToStudentLogitProjector`** in `models/distillation_framework.py`
- Projects teacher logits into student vocabulary space via learnable linear map
- Removes need for truncation/padding and preserves teacher distribution semantics

**Code Changes:**
teacher_probs = F.softmax(aligned_teacher_logits / temperature, dim=-1)
```python
teacher_probs = F.softmax(teacher_logits / temperature, dim=-1)
projected_teacher_logits = self.logit_projector(teacher_probs)
student_log_probs = F.log_softmax(student_logits / temperature, dim=-1)
teacher_probs = F.softmax(projected_teacher_logits / temperature, dim=-1)
```

### 2. Dataset Loading Issue üü°

**Problem:**
```
Warning: Could not load dataset openwebtext: The repository for Skylion007/openwebtext contains custom code which must be executed to correctly load the dataset.
```

**Root Cause:**
- `openwebtext` dataset requires `trust_remote_code=True` parameter
- Script didn't handle this requirement properly

**Solution:**
- **Added `trust_remote_code=True`** to openwebtext dataset loading
- **Enhanced error handling** with fallback to wikitext-2 if other datasets fail
- **Improved dataset loading robustness**

**Code Changes:**
```python
elif dataset_name == "openwebtext":
    ds = load_dataset("Skylion007/openwebtext", split="train",
                     cache_dir=self.cache_dir, trust_remote_code=True)
```

### 3. Attention Implementation Warnings üü°

**Problem:**
```
`torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` does not support `output_attentions=True`. Falling back to eager attention.
```

**Root Cause:**
- Models defaulting to flash attention which doesn't support attention output extraction
- Distillation requires attention patterns for transfer

**Solution:**
- **Added `attn_implementation="eager"`** to model loading
- Forces use of eager attention implementation
- Ensures attention patterns are properly extracted

**Code Changes:**
```python
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    attn_implementation="eager"  # Fix attention implementation
)
```

```

## Technical Details

### 4. Router Dimension Mismatch üü°

**Problem:**
```
RuntimeError: Sizes of tensors must match except in dimension 2. Expected size 512 but got size 576 for tensor number 1 in the list.
```

**Root Cause:**
- Student and teacher models have different sequence lengths (512 vs 576) 
- Router tried to concatenate/stack tensors with mismatched dimensions
- Expert outputs had different sequence lengths than student hidden states

**Solution:**
- **Added sequence length alignment** using linear interpolation in `StudentCapacityEstimator`
- **Added dimension projection layers** for teacher-to-student alignment
- **Fixed expert output alignment** in `AdaptiveExpertRouter.forward()`
- **Enhanced tensor operations** with proper shape handling

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Sequence length alignment
if teacher_seq_len != student_seq_len:
    teacher_seq_aligned = F.interpolate(
        teacher_hidden.transpose(1, 2),
        size=student_seq_len,
        mode='linear',
        align_corners=False
    ).transpose(1, 2)

# Dimension projection
self.teacher_to_student_proj = nn.Linear(teacher_dim, student_dim)
teacher_proj = self.teacher_to_student_proj(teacher_seq_aligned)

# Expert output alignment
for expert_output in teacher_expert_outputs:
    if expert_seq != seq_len:
        aligned_expert = F.interpolate(
            expert_output.transpose(1, 2),
            size=seq_len,
            mode='linear',
            align_corners=False
        ).transpose(1, 2)
```
