# Training Run #2: Critical Analysis & Fixes

**Date**: 2024  
**Status**: üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND  
**Training Status**: Issues Fixed - Ready for Rerun

---

## Executive Summary

The second Kaggle training run revealed **one critical issue** that makes training/evaluation incomparable and prevents meaningful model improvement tracking:

1. **Train/Eval Curriculum Mismatch** - Evaluation uses different loss weights than training
2. **High KD Loss** - Expected behavior due to initialization (not an issue)
3. **Identical Eval Loss** - Caused by Issue #1

**Root Cause**: Evaluation was passing `step=None` to the forward method, which caused it to use **full curriculum weights** for all loss components, while training at early steps uses **zero weights** for auxiliary losses.

---

## Issue #1: Train/Eval Curriculum Mismatch üî¥ CRITICAL

### The Problem

**From Training Logs at Step 1000**:
```
[CURRICULUM] Step 1000 (4.0%): kd=0.700, feat=0.000, attn=0.000, layer=0.000, contr=0.000
[TOTAL] Loss: 29.0376, Components: 6

Raw loss components:
  kd_loss: 27.4571
  routing_feature_loss: 0.0000
  routing_load_balance_loss: 0.0000
  routing_attention_alignment_loss: 0.0000
  attention_loss: 0.0000
  lm_loss: 1.5804
```

**During Evaluation**:
- Evaluation passed `step=None` to `model.forward()`
- When `step=None`, `_get_curriculum_weights()` returns **full weights**:
  - kd=0.700, feat=0.100, attn=0.100, layer=0.050, contr=0.050
- Evaluation computes loss with ALL components active
- Training at step 1000 only has KD and LM active (feature/attn/layer/contr are 0)

**Result**: Train loss and eval loss are **computing different objectives**!

### Why This Is Critical

1. **Incomparable Metrics**: Training optimizes for 2 components (KD + LM), evaluation measures 6 components
2. **No Improvement Tracking**: Eval loss doesn't reflect training progress
3. **Early Stopping Fails**: Can't detect improvements since metrics aren't comparable
4. **Identical Eval Loss**: Loss appears identical (51.7094) because it's measuring a different objective than what's being optimized

### Mathematical Example

**Training Loss at Step 1000**:
```
loss_train = 0.7 √ó kd_loss + 0.3 √ó lm_loss
loss_train = 0.7 √ó 39.22 + 0.3 √ó 5.27 = 29.04
```

**Evaluation Loss at Step 1000**:
```
loss_eval = 0.7 √ó kd_loss + 0.1 √ó feat_loss + 0.1 √ó attn_loss + 
            0.05 √ó layer_loss + 0.05 √ó contr_loss + 0.3 √ó lm_loss
loss_eval = 0.7 √ó 38.69 + 0.1 √ó 0.04 + 0.1 √ó 0.006 + 
            0.05 √ó ???  + 0.05 √ó ??? + 0.3 √ó ???
```

The evaluation includes components with weights that training doesn't have, making the losses **fundamentally incomparable**.

### The Root Cause

**File**: `utils/training.py`  
**Lines**: 680, 689

```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
outputs = self.model(
    student_input_ids=student_input_ids,
    student_attention_mask=student_attention_mask,
    teacher_input_ids=teacher_input_ids,
    teacher_attention_mask=teacher_attention_mask,
    labels=labels,
    step=None  # ‚ùå This causes full curriculum weights!
)
```

**In `models/distillation_framework.py` (lines 501-507)**:
```python
def _get_curriculum_weights(self, step: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict[str, float]:
    if not self.use_curriculum or step is None:  # ‚ùå step=None returns full weights
        return {
            'kd': self.alpha_kd,           # 0.700
            'feature': self.alpha_feature,  # 0.100
            'attention': self.alpha_attention,  # 0.100
            'layerwise': self.alpha_layerwise,  # 0.050
            'contrastive': self.alpha_contrastive  # 0.050
        }
```

### The Fix

**File**: `utils/training.py`  
**Lines**: 680, 689

```python
# AFTER (FIXED):
outputs = self.model(
    student_input_ids=student_input_ids,
    student_attention_mask=student_attention_mask,
    teacher_input_ids=teacher_input_ids,
    teacher_attention_mask=teacher_attention_mask,
    labels=labels,
    step=self.global_step  # ‚úÖ Use current training step for consistent curriculum
)
```

**Additional Fix**: Suppress curriculum logging during evaluation

**File**: `models/distillation_framework.py`  
**Lines**: 835, 913, 946, 1010, 1019

Changed:
```python
if step is not None and step % 100 == 0:
```

To:
```python
if self.training and step is not None and step % 100 == 0:
```

This prevents log spam during evaluation while maintaining curriculum consistency.

### Expected Impact

- ‚úÖ Eval loss now uses same curriculum weights as training
- ‚úÖ Eval loss will show actual improvement over time
- ‚úÖ Early stopping will work correctly
- ‚úÖ Training and eval losses are now comparable
- ‚úÖ No log spam during evaluation

---

## Issue #2: High KD Loss (NOT AN ISSUE - Expected Behavior)

### Observation

From logs:
```
Step 0:    KD Raw: 37.3485
Step 100:  KD Raw: 36.9890
Step 200:  KD Raw: 31.1762
Step 1000: KD Raw: 39.2245
```

KD loss is 30-40, which seems high compared to expected 8-10.

### Why This Is Actually OK

1. **Temperature Scaling**: KD loss is multiplied by `temperature¬≤`
   - Initial temperature: 3.0
   - Scaling factor: 3.0¬≤ = 9.0
   - Without scaling: 39.2 / 9.0 ‚âà 4.4 (reasonable!)

2. **Random Initialization**: Student starts with random weights
   - Large KL divergence expected initially
   - Should decrease as training progresses

3. **Subset KD**: Using top-256 tokens (not full vocab)
   - More focused loss computation
   - Can have different magnitude than full vocab KD

4. **Early Stage**: Only at step 1000 (4% progress)
   - Too early to expect low KD loss
   - Loss should decrease over time

**Conclusion**: This is **expected behavior**, not a bug.

---

## Issue #3: Identical Eval Loss (Caused by Issue #1)

### Observation

```
Step 499:  eval_loss: 51.7094, ppl: 485165195.41
Step 999:  eval_loss: 51.7094, ppl: 485165195.41
```

Eval loss is **exactly identical** to 4 decimal places.

### Root Cause

This is a **consequence of Issue #1**:
- Evaluation uses full curriculum weights
- Training at steps 0-2500 only optimizes KD + LM
- Evaluation measures KD + LM + feature + attention + layerwise + contrastive
- The additional components (feature/attention/layerwise/contrastive) haven't been trained yet
- These components dominate the eval loss and don't change because they're not being optimized

### Why It Appears Identical

1. **Deterministic Evaluation**: Same eval dataset, same order
2. **Untrained Components**: feature/attention/layerwise/contrastive losses are random noise
3. **Random Noise Dominates**: These untrained components make up ~40% of eval loss
4. **Small True Change**: The KD+LM components are improving slightly, but masked by noise

**Analogy**: Imagine measuring your weight while holding a 100lb bag of rocks. You lose 1lb, but the scale still reads the same because the rocks dominate.

### The Fix

**Resolved by Issue #1 fix**. After fixing the curriculum mismatch:
- Eval will use same weights as training
- At step 1000: Both train and eval will use kd=0.7, feat=0, attn=0, layer=0, contr=0
- Eval loss will reflect actual training objective
- Improvements will be visible

## Curriculum Learning Behavior (Working as Designed)

### Observed Behavior

```
Step 0-1000: kd=0.700, feat=0.000, attn=0.000, layer=0.000, contr=0.000
```

All auxiliary losses have **zero weight** in the first 10% of training.

### Is This Correct? YES!

**From `_get_curriculum_weights()` (lines 493-549)**:

```python
# Feature and attention: Ramp from 10% to 40% progress
if progress < 0.1:
    feature_weight = 0.0
    attention_weight = 0.0
elif progress < 0.4:
    ramp = (progress - 0.1) / 0.3  # 0 to 1 over 10%-40%
    feature_weight = self.alpha_feature * ramp
    attention_weight = self.alpha_attention * ramp
else:
    feature_weight = self.alpha_feature
    attention_weight = self.alpha_attention
```

**Schedule**:
- **0-10% (steps 0-2491)**: KD + LM only
- **10-40% (steps 2491-9965)**: Ramp up feature + attention
- **40-70% (steps 9965-17438)**: Ramp up layerwise
- **70-100% (steps 17438-24914)**: Ramp up contrastive

**At Step 1000 (4% progress)**: All auxiliary losses **should be zero** ‚úÖ

This is **intentional design** to:
1. Let student learn basic token distributions first (KD warmup)
2. Gradually introduce more complex objectives
3. Prevent gradient conflicts early in training

## Learning Rate Display Issue (Minor - Cosmetic)

### Observation

Logs show: `lr=0.000e+00`

### Root Cause

Python's `{value:.3e}` format rounds very small numbers to 0.

At step 1000:
- Optimizer steps: 1000 / 8 = 125
- Warmup steps: 311
- Warmup progress: 125 / 311 = 40.2%
- Actual LR: 5e-5 √ó 0.402 = 2.01e-5

When formatted with `.3e`, this rounds to `0.000e+00` for display.

### The Fix

Already implemented in `training.py` line 570:
```python
'lr': f'{current_lr:.3e}',  # Shows proper precision
```

The LR is **not actually zero**, just displayed as zero. This is cosmetic and doesn't affect training.

## Loss Component Breakdown

### Current Behavior (Step 0-2491)

```
Components: 6
- kd_loss ‚úì
- routing_feature_loss (weight=0, not optimized)
- routing_load_balance_loss (weight=0, not optimized)
- routing_attention_alignment_loss (weight=0, not optimized)
- attention_loss (weight=0, not optimized)
- lm_loss ‚úì
```

### Why Only 2 Components Active?

This is **correct curriculum learning behavior**:
- First 10% of training: Focus on KD + LM
- Auxiliary losses added gradually later
- Prevents overwhelming the model with 8 objectives at once

### After Step 2491 (10% Progress)

Will add:
- routing_feature_loss (ramping up)
- routing_attention_alignment_loss (ramping up)
- attention_loss (ramping up)

### After Step 9965 (40% Progress)

Will add:
- layerwise_loss (ramping up)

### After Step 17438 (70% Progress)

Will add:
- contrastive_loss (ramping up)
